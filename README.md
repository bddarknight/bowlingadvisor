<h1>Bowling Tip for Beginners: How Young Can Kids Start Bowling?</h1>

<p>My bowling tip for beginners is, if they can walk, they can roll the ball! Maybe not at the bowling center, but at home. Sure, these plastic bowling balls and pins are perfect on any flat surface, like the basement, backyard, or garage. They can set the pins up and take turns bowling them down.  Besides keeping them busy, they also get exercise running back and forth, and learning the necessary skills in bowling, knocking down the pins.</p>

<p>This bowling tip for beginners is a good start. These plastic pins are safe, plus they learn how to roll <a href="https://bowlingadvisor.com">the bowling ball</a> before they go to the bowling center. So, they are more confident in their bowling skills, and not so easily frustrated, the first time visiting the bowling center. Of course, the bowling balls will be heavier than the 3-5 pound plastic bowling balls, usually 6-8 pounds. But if you ask, some bowling centers have lighter bowling balls held in the back, just for the little ones. Even preschools offer bowling as a form of recreation, so the children can play together.</p>

<p>The final bowling tip for beginners is, bowling is more fun if you know what you are doing. Starting the kids off with a head start gives them something to run with, and feeling good about their abilities. Make bowling a family activity, and encourage fun for all!</p>
